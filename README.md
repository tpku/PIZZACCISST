# THE PIZZACCISST!

My first little php project! A website including a basic pizza game. Don't forget to read the instructions. Good luck and don't get lost! Ciao!

# Installation

1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Open folder with Visual Studio Code
3. Open terminal / new terminal and type: php -S localhost:4000
4. Type: localhost:4000 in a web browser of choice. Google Chrome recommended.

# Code Review

Code review written by [Siri Sjölin](https://github.com/sirisayshello).

Amazing page. I made a splendid pizza. 

1. `functions.php:8-12` - This function is never called, could probably be removed?
2. `functions.php:16` - Is this require needed here?
3. `functions.php:21-50` - These functions basically does the same thing, maybe call the first one twice?
4. `index.php:31-50` - Since the conditions are the same this could be one if statement instead of two.
5. `index.php:47-49` - Could use a link here instead since you don’t need to post any values to page2.
